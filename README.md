# DLH-project

This repo contains code I wrote for the Deep Learning in Healthcare module assessment (3rd-year Oxford CS module). I conducted a short research project titled "Active Learning with Data Augmentation for Organ Classification in Medical Images"; this repo contains the Jupyter notebook I used to conduct my experiments and a copy of the finished paper. Below is the paper abstract:

> _Medical image processing, and more specifically classification, is a crucially important step in both diagnosis and treatment, and consequently deep learning approaches have been explored to accelerate the process. However, such approaches naturally struggle at this task for two key reasons: suitable data is hard to come by due to privacy concerns and other real-world factors; and image labelling requires significant expertise and time. The scarcity of suitable, well-labelled medical images thus motivates approaches that maximise the information gained from each and every label. In this paper, we assess the merits of active learning (using the modelâ€™s predictions on unlabelled data to choose which new labels would be the most informative) and data augmentation (applying small changes to some images to increase dataset diversity) for this purpose on the task of organ classification. We demonstrate that training using active learning gives the most reliable improvements on the base training method. We also show that a combination of active learning and data augmentation is not as effective as either individually, and we propose an explanation as to why this might be the case._
